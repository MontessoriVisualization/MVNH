# Google Drive Connection Files

This document identifies all files in the MVNH website that are connected to Google Drive.

## Summary

The website uses Google Drive to host and embed preview content. All Google Drive connections are found in the compiled JavaScript bundle.

## Files Containing Google Drive References

### 1. `/assets/index-qGsR9eGM.js`

**Type:** Compiled JavaScript Bundle (Minified)

**Purpose:** Main application JavaScript containing all the business logic and component code for the website.

**Google Drive Integration:**

#### Direct File Embed URLs

The following Google Drive file preview URLs are embedded in the application:

1. **File ID: 1v1-VHUG6GV-An0PKV8obHamTq-c4hz0i**
   - URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v1-VHUG6GV-An0PKV8obHamTq-c4hz0i/preview`
   - This URL appears multiple times in the code (likely used across different components)

2. **File ID: 1M5N9_h9KD7UmXC4Z7g1DPeJkmfGGDUNP**
   - URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M5N9_h9KD7UmXC4Z7g1DPeJkmfGGDUNP/preview`

3. **File ID: 1o4gssCXW3kZIsxV099TVhgAQtTiSEhR2**
   - URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o4gssCXW3kZIsxV099TVhgAQtTiSEhR2/preview`

#### Google APIs Integration

The JavaScript bundle also includes references to Google APIs, specifically:

- **`gapi` (Google API JavaScript Client Library)**: Used for loading Google API services
- **`gapi.iframes`**: Used for iframe-based authentication and embedding
- **Google Identity Toolkit API endpoints:**
  - `identitytoolkit.googleapis.com`
  - `staging-identitytoolkit.sandbox.googleapis.com`
  - `test-identitytoolkit.sandbox.googleapis.com`

These API references are part of Firebase Authentication integration, which uses Google's identity services.

## Technical Implementation

### Embedding Method

The Google Drive files are embedded using the `/preview` endpoint, which allows:
- Direct embedding of Google Drive files in iframes
- Preview functionality without requiring download
- Public or shared link access to the files

### Code Location

Since the code is minified and bundled, the actual source code that references these Google Drive URLs would be in the original React/JavaScript source files before compilation. The build process (likely using Vite based on the references in `index.html`) bundles all source files into `assets/index-qGsR9eGM.js`.

## Files NOT Containing Google Drive References

The following files were checked but do NOT contain Google Drive connections:

- `/index.html` - Main HTML file (loads the JS bundle)
- `/404.html` - Error page
- `/assets/index-D6ggm79b.css` - CSS stylesheet
- `/Firebase/.gitignore` - Firebase configuration directory (currently only contains .gitignore)
- All image assets in `/assets/` directory

## Recommendations

1. **Source Code Access**: To make changes to the Google Drive URLs, you would need access to the original source code (likely in a `src/` directory) before it's compiled.

2. **URL Management**: Consider centralizing all Google Drive URLs in a configuration file or environment variables for easier management.

3. **Content Security**: Ensure that all Google Drive files referenced have appropriate sharing permissions (public or anyone with the link).

4. **Build Process**: The website appears to be built with Vite. To modify the Google Drive connections, you would need to:
   - Access the source repository
   - Update the URLs in the source files
   - Rebuild the project (`npm run build` or similar)
   - Deploy the new compiled assets

## How to Update Google Drive Links

1. Locate the source code repository (not just the deployed `gh-pages` branch)
2. Search for the Google Drive URLs in the source files:
   ```bash
   grep -r "drive.google.com" src/
   ```
3. Update the URLs as needed
4. Rebuild the project
5. Deploy the updated build to the `gh-pages` branch
